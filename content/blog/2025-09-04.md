I’ve been thinking about making this for years. Even before Elon bought Twitter, I knew the feeds were breaking my brain. Currently my social media situation is a little Tumblr (sinking pirate ship), Linkedin (cursed), and probably too much Youtube. Even that makes my brain feel fried.

But I came up on the bloggy internet and that's what I want back. A space all my own to write and explore and build. Notably, I definitely don't want a newsletter that alerts everyone when I’ve had a thought. This feels much more respectful. It has been weirdly hard to build this. Like, obviously I have resisted learning how to code and I don't even think this counts, but how do I add a stupid background to this website? I do not know! But it is sort of fun to figure it out, and certainly a good lesson to be able to sit with this being janky and bad, but still my own. Idk, it tracks that now that AI is taking all the coding jobs, and there isn't all this virtue-signaling that comes with coding, I'm finally willing to learn the tiniest bit.

Not to be insane, but isn’t this what life is? Finding a little corner of space and tending to it and making it better by making it yours but also allowing others to come visit and also learning new things for no reason other than to have fun?
