I have read more Drarry fanfiction than I have read anything else, really. I spent so much time with those characters and in the worlds the authors of these fanworks built out. I don't read very much fanfic these days but I've been left with the question of what mark all that reading left on me. I think it's easier to point out how a traditionally published book impacted you, if only because it's much less shameful to talk about with real people. But, again, I cannot emphasize just how much of this content I have taken it. I think it's fully reshaped my brain, I just don't quite know how. I started thinking about thie when I was listening to this Cannonball episode about artists' last albums and how sometimes you think you're going to die, and then you don't, and then you have to go on with the business of living. I think there was a lot of that in the fanfic I read. I don't know why it scratched such an itch, but it did. What it means to believe something terrible and then change and atone. That the places we live have some type of sentience. Idk man.
