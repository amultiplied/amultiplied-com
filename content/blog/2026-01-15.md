Maya found a piece of dryer lint and domesticated it. Her name is Donavan Fluff, she is Maya’s pet (never mind Kulfi, the actual dog she lives with). She kept losing it, because it is a piece of dryer lint, and we had to keep spotting it on our intricately patterned rug. Finally, I found her an old apothecary jar and now that is where Donavan Fluff lives, but by now her name is Elena of Avalor Fluff. Maya didn’t want to sleep without Fluff, so we put the jar on the windowsill next to her bed, which we all promptly forgot about. The next night, we all spent like ten minutes searching, until she finally remembered. Rohan went into the bedroom to go retrieve the jar, and then Nishant started crying. Anyway, that’s the story of how Maya got a pet.
