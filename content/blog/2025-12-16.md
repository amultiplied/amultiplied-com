I read Heated Rivalry last night in one go because everyone is talking about the new TV show and it was...fine? Sometimes, romance novels sneak into the culture as high literary works (Sally Rooney) and people lose their mind because they don't let themselves read romance. This felt similar — it follows the plot structure of fanfic (no dark moment, just vibes), the tropes were SO classic (from last names to first names), the lack of women, etc. Just let yourself read fanfic, friends!
